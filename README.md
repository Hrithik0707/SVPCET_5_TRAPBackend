# Problem Statement
Using technology to bully is a problem that is on the rise which can lead to the decreased mental health of people. To tackle the problem of cyber-bullying and hate speech, the toxicity of the message being transported can be determined and used to decide whether a message is offensive or not. In case it is offensive, the user can ask his/her friends for a review to evaluate if it safe or not which can be done in the form of a voting system using decentralized application and block-chain

# Solution
  1. Firstly creating a text classifier using Natural language Processing for classify the statements.
  2. Used Python's Django framework for creating webapp
  3. Used created NLP text classifier for classifing statements and creating a POll.
  4. Once the poll is created any user can vote to the poll.
  5. For creating a decentralized network we will be implementing blockhain architecture for decentralized application in python.
